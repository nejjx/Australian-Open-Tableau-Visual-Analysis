# 🎾 Australian Open: A 120-Year Data Visualisation in Tableau

This project presents a comprehensive visual analysis of 120 years of Australian Open Tennis Championship data, uncovering patterns in player nationality, gender representation, performance across sets, and win ratios of top players. Created using **Tableau**, the dashboard highlights both historical trends and actionable insights.

## 📌 Overview

- **Scope**: 1905–2024 Australian Open Championships
- **Tools Used**: Tableau, Excel
- **Objective**: Identify hidden trends in player performance and champion demographics

## 📊 Key Visualizations

### 🌍 Geographic Map
Visualizes champion nationalities by count and maximum win ratio. Revealed:
- France had the highest winning ratio (88.89%) despite few champions
- Australia and USA dominate in number of champions

### 🚹🚺 Gender Treemap
Explores gender distribution within each country.
- Found almost equal representation in AUS and USA
- Some countries (e.g. Serbia) had only male champions

### ⏱️ Parallel Coordinates
Tracks max winning ratios across 5 sets over time.
- Found inconsistencies in later sets (4th/5th) potentially linked to gender-based match formats

### 🏆 Top Player Scatter Plot
Compares win ratios of top players against their opponents.
- Serena Williams had highest win ratio (80%)
- Serbian/Swiss players won most titles but had lower win ratios

## 🔍 Insights & Recommendations
